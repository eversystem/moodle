s:1973:"<p>The template defines the program(s) that run in the sandbox for a given
student answer and test(s). There are two
types of template:</p>

<ul><li>a per-test template, which defines a program to be run for a single test case and,</li>
<li>a 'combinator' template which defines a program that combines all the different cases into a single program.</li>
</ul><p>The 'is_combinator' checkbox is left unchecked for a per-test template and is
set checked for a combinator template. The rest of this help panel assumes you
are using a per-test template; see the full documentation for the use of
combinator templates.</p>

<p>The template is processed
by the Twig template engine (see http://twig.sensiolabs.org)
in a context in which STUDENT_ANSWER is the student's
response and TEST.testcode is the code for the current testcase. These values
(and other testcase values like TEST.expected, TEST.stdin, TEST.mark)
can be inserted into the template by enclosing them in double braces, e.g.
<tt>{{TEST.testcode}}</tt>. For use within literal strings, an appropriate escape
function should be applied, e.g. <tt>{{STUDENT_ANSWER | e('py')}}</tt> is the student
answer escaped in a manner suitable for use within Python triple-double-quoted
strings. Other escape functions are <tt>e('c')</tt>, <tt>e('java')</tt>,
<tt>e('matlab')</tt>. The program that is output by Twig is then compiled and executed
with the language of the selected built-in type and with stdin set
to TEST.stdin. Output from that program is then passed to the selected grader.
See the help under 'Grading controls' for more on that.</p>

<p>Note that if a customised per-test template is used
there will be a compile-and-execute cycle for every test case, whereas most
built-in question types define instead a combinator template that combines
all test cases into a single run.</p>

<p>If the template-debugging checkbox is clicked, the program generated
for each testcase will be displayed in the output.</p>
